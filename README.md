# StartCPP
A simple and super lightweight mingw Dev Environment for c++ programmers in windows
```diff
+ Pros:
  1. No more waiting for Visual Studio to start, (cause we'll be using vscode or any other text editor really! -winky face- )
  2. Super lightweight, only kilobytes in size.
```

```diff
- Cons:
  1. Does require to install mingw
  2. Only works in windows (for now ðŸ˜‰)
```

## Installation:
* Method 1:
  * Install Mingw.
  * Just **clone** the repo.
* Method 2:
  * Install Mingw.
  * Download as **zip** file.
  * Extract "wherever" you want.
  

## Use:
* Place your **.cpp** files in `src/sources` folder
* Build & Run by running corresponding ***.bat*** file
- [x] Bonus Tips:
  * Learn some makefile coding to modify the compiling process to your liking!
  * If you're using vscode, you can use `Code Runner` extension to run **build.bat** and **run.bat** from within vscode!
